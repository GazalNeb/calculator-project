This calculator is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS(&SCSS), as the second project of the software development course by _Nology. 

The calculator performs the following operations on any two values (integer or decimal) at a given time:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (รท)
5. Percentage (%)
6. Change sign of either value from negative to positive (or vice-versa) (+/-)

If an operator is added while another exists on the display-bar, the existing operation is performed first.

The CA button clears all the values in the display-bar, and C1 button removes one digit at a time.
